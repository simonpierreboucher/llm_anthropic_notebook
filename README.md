### Notebooks Overview

1. **ANTHROPIC-CHATBOT.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook demonstrates the use of an Anthropic model as a chatbot, focusing on dialogue management and responsive conversation flow.
   - **Contents**: The notebook likely includes setup instructions for initializing the model, preprocessing user inputs, and creating a loop or function to handle conversational exchanges.
   - **Usage**: Useful for creating chatbot applications powered by Anthropic models, with potential applications in customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive Q&A.

2. **ANTHROPIC-RAG.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook is centered around Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the model retrieves relevant information before generating a response. RAG combines retrieval of pertinent data with generative abilities, enhancing accuracy and relevance.
   - **Contents**: Includes steps for integrating a retrieval module (likely using embeddings or a search index), and combines retrieved information with model-generated responses for context-aware answers.
   - **Usage**: Ideal for information-based applications, such as customer support or knowledge retrieval systems, where responses are grounded in specific sources.

3. **ANTHROPIC-TEXTGEN.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook enables exploration of the Anthropic model's text generation capabilities, focusing on generating creative or informative text.
   - **Contents**: Contains setup for generation parameters (e.g., temperature, max tokens), prompt construction, and text generation examples based on user prompts.
   - **Usage**: Suitable for applications in content creation, narrative generation, or other areas requiring high-quality, generative text outputs.

### Navigation and Usage

1. **Opening the Notebooks**: Load the notebooks in Jupyter by navigating to the directory and running `jupyter notebook`.
2. **Running Each Notebook**: Follow the embedded instructions within each notebook to set up and use the model for the respective use case (Chatbot, RAG, or Text Generation).
